# CodeRefactor_NickP_Homework

## Desciption

This is my homework **README** for my first assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp. We were given starter code to rafactor. I was able to update some div with semantic tags. I condsalidated the CSS sheet, and added some commentating within the code. We were to improve the aceesibility and make sure everything was working as intended. Thing I did notice when the screen size was below a certain point the site layout would break a bit. I believe I fixed that issue.
